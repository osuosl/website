- name: LLVM Memory Order Loads Handling
  description:
    The C standard currently specifies that that memory_order_consume loads feed into carries a dependency, however, no
    known implementation does anything other than promote memory_order_consume to memory_order_acquire. C users
    therefore avoid memory_order_consume loads in favour of volatile loads, inline assembly, and other subterfuge. There
    has been considerable work within the C++ standards committee to address similar issues in C++, however, the current
    proposals involve C++ templates, which have no reasonable C equivalent. We proposes a new _Dependent_ptr type
    qualifier to provide this functionality in the C language. We are implementing the same in LLVM.

  description:
    MRCC is a suite of ab initio and density functional quantum chemistry programs for high-accuracy electronic
    structure calculations developed and maintained by the quantum chemistry research group at the Department of
    Physical Chemistry and Materials Science, TU Budapest. Its special feature, the use of automated programming tools
    enabled the development of tensor manipulation routines which are independent of the number of indices of the
    corresponding tensors, thus significantly simplifying the general implementation of quantum chemical methods.
    Applying the automated tools of the program several quantum chemistry models and techniques of high complexity have
    been implemented so far including arbitrary single-reference coupled-cluster (CC) and configuration interaction (CI)
    methods, multi-reference CC approaches, CC and CI energy derivatives and response functions, arbitrary perturbative
    CC approaches. Many features of the package are also available with relativistic Hamiltonians allowing for accurate
    calculations on heavy element systems. The developed cost-reduction techniques and local correlation approaches also
    enable high-precision calculations for medium-sized and large molecules.
