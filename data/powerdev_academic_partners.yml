  description: The Linux kernel exposes subtle and informally specified relaxed-memory semantics to programmers. To understand them and to develop formal models to use in verification, we adopt an empirical approach by testing what results parallel kernel code can actually produce when executed on the hardware. The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a key ingredient of our approach, a tool which takes small 'litmus tests' and generates Linux kernel modules to run them for many iterations, collecting statistics of their behavior.
