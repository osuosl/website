[Zachary Wallace](#zachary-wallace){#zachary-wallace}

  **Student Systems Engineer**

![Zach Wallace](/images/zwall.png#right-people)

Starting in November of 2022, Zach was brought aboard during his Junior year of his college career as a Computer Science major. Zach's first introduction to programming dated back to the fifth grade, in 2013, where he did a presentation on "How to Create an Adder in Lua". His first experience with the Linux environment started in late-2019, when he used a Raspberry-Pi to set up a local file sharing server; and ever since then he's used some flavor of Linux as a daily driver for both personal and server use. Outside of the office and classroom, Zach enjoys modding games, with an added interest in level design. With now being employed at the Open Source Lab, he hopes to further understand the duties of a systems administrator while also providing assistance in service hosting for the FOSS community.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

![Oria Weng](/images/o.webp#right-people)

Oria has been excited about open-source software from far too young an age, so no one should have told her there was an Open Source Lab right at OSU! In all seriousness, she started at the OSL in November 2022 as a way to further explore computer science and get involved in the open-source community. When not learning new ways to play on computers, she dabbles in digital drawing, board games, and animation.
