The OSL and the Oregon State University
[School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu) have a joint commitment
to expand open source and devops curriculum to an increased number of students.
DevOps BootCamp provides the OSL with a channel to reach out to students
interested in DevOps and open source, regardless of their discipline. DevOps
BootCamp is an OSL and [OSU Linux Users Group](http://lug.oregonstate.edu) program that aims to boost our
impact and outreach while shrinking the skills gap for Oregon State students
interested in DevOps.

DevOps BootCamp strives to supply interested students with the practical skills
required to succeed as software developers and system engineers. The BootCamp
functions as an extracurricular training program that meets two or three times
every month during the school year. During these sessions OSL students and
software professionals instruct those interested on necessary topics. DevOps
BootCamp starts with the basics and does not assume familiarity with software
development or Linux.
