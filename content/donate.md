The OSL offers support services to the world's leading open source projects as part of its mission to contribute to the
growth of open source software. By hosting pioneering projects, building connections between industry and the public
sector, and training a new generation of open source innovators, the Lab promotes open source software that people
around the world can create and use together.

What we do
----------

The OSU Open Source lab currently hosts ~1,000 sub-projects. We provide hosting for medium to large high impact FOSS
projects who need a neutral hosting. We strive to help projects in whichever means we are able to which includes simply
providing access to a virtual machine to fully managing their infrastructure.  Some of our high profile projects we
currently provide hosting for include: Linux Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, Python Software Foundation,
Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Busybox/Buildroot, phpBB, GCC Compile Farm, qemu, Jenkins, ROS. Our popular software mirror
hosts over 12T of data with over 100 projects included.

The lab employs and mentors undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience managing all of the infrastructure we
provide to projects many of which graduate and become prolific FOSS contributors. These students experience real-world
production systems and architectures which is valuable and difficult to do at most universities.

In addition, we collaborate with private industry to provide a neutral hosting facility for non-x86 architectures. Our
largest collaboration is with IBM in which we host over 100 projects on an OpenPOWER based OpenStack cluster to enable
porting which include projects such as Docker, Go Language, TensorFlow, LLVM and TravisCI to name a few. We are in the
process of collaborating with other vendors to provide access to other architectures such as ARM64.
