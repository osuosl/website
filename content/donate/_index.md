The OSU Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) offers support services to the world’s leading Open Source projects as part of its
mission to contribute to the growth of Open Source software. By hosting pioneering projects, building connections
between the public and private sectors, and training a new generation of  innovators, the Lab promotes Open Source
software that people around the world can create and use together.

## What we do

OSUOSL currently hosts ~1,000 sub-projects. We provide hosting for medium to large high-impact FOSS projects that need a
neutral hosting provider. We strive to help projects however possible: from simply providing access to a virtual
machine, all the way to fully managing their infrastructure. Some of the high-profile projects for which we currently
provide hosting include: The Linux Foundation, PostmarketOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Busybox/Buildroot, phpBB, GCC
Compile Farm, qemu, Jenkins, ROS. Our popular software mirror hosts over 12T of data with over 100 projects included.

The Lab employs and mentors undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience managing all of the infrastructure we
provide to projects. Many of our students graduate and become prolific FOSS contributors, and some have gone on to found
their own tech companies. These young professionals experience real-world production systems and architectures, gaining
highly valuable skills that are difficult to acquire at most universities.

In addition, we collaborate with private industry to provide a neutral hosting facility for non-x86 architectures. Our
largest collaboration is with IBM, for whom we host over 100 projects on an OpenPOWER-based OpenStack cluster. This
collaboration includes projects such as Docker, Go Language, TensorFlow, LLVM and TravisCI, among others. We collaborate
with Ampere Computing to provide access to the ARM64 architecture, and with the RISC-V Foundation to provide access to
the RISC-V architecture.
