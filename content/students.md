Our students are our highest priority at the lab and each one brings different
skills and ideas to the workplace. They receive hands-on experience with open
source software and technology along with mentorship from full-time,
professional staff.

We also recognize our employees are students and members of society outside of
the OSL and we are equally proud of their accomplishments beyond the lab.

Explore our Student Experience pages to find out more about what it means to be
part of the OSL family.

The OSL is funded on individual donations and a handful of contracted projects.
You now have the opportunity to fund one of our student employees and give them
the chance at a life changing opportunity and to become part of the next
generation of open source leaders.
