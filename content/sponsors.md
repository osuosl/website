IBM has contributed to projects hosted at the Open Source Lab by donating hardware resources and through financial
contributions.

IBM has long been an advocate, sponsor and contributor to the Linux developer community and Open Technology
development. Continuing this tradition of support, IBM has contributed a number of POWER servers to the OSL for the
purpose of Linux and open source project development by the community on the Power Architecture. Please see our
[development hosting](/services/powerdev) page for more information and SSH-based remote access to Linux on POWER servers.

Google is one of the world's leading search engines and a leader in the Web services industry. According to their
website, "Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." The
OSL shares in this mission by organizing the resources of the open source community, making it easier for developers to
focus on writing code.

Google sponsors the OSL through financial grants. This funding helps the OSL provide the community with physical
hosting and bandwidth, and covers the cost of "Smart Hands" support. Google is a big supporter of the open source
movement, producing open code of their own, and sponsoring the Summer of Code program.  Each year Google puts millions
of dollars toward open source research and development through this program.

TDS Telecom is a major telephone and Internet services provider. TDS Telecom has made a large donation of bandwidth to
the Open Source Lab, helping millions of people review or download free software every day.

For a five-year period, the OSL will receive 40 gigabits of bandwidth. In addition, several OSU servers will be hosted
at several TDS data centers. The bandwidth provided gives the OSL the ability to host FTP servers in both New York,
NY, and Chicago, IL, where files for many open source projects are mirrored for download from the main FTP server
hosted in Corvallis, OR.
