[Linux.com](http://linux.com/) is now being run by the [Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/) and, along with
most of the other Linux Foundation infrastructure, is hosted at the OSU Open Source Lab.

The site has historically been a source for articles, information, and online forums about the Linux operating system.
Under the Linux Foundation, the site will undergo a face lift in the coming months. An IdeaForge site has been launched
at <http://ideaforge.linux.com/> where you can view and make suggestions about what you would like to see on the future
Linux.com site.
