Summer conference season is upon us, and employees of the OSL will be giving several talks. Kicking off June's
festivities, [Leslie Hawthorn](http://twitter.com/lhawthorn) will be discussing "Humanitarian Free and Open Source
Software: Saving the World One Bit at a Time" at [Southeast LinuxFest](http://southeastlinuxfest.org/). The conference
runs from June 10-12 in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Leslie will be speaking this Friday, June 10th.

If you find yourself in Portland, Oregon for [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/), you'll hear from all
our technical staff at the conference. [Tim Harder](http://opensourcebridge.org/users/534) will be covering
[OSWALD: Lessons from and for the Open Hardware Movement](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/629).
[Lance Albertson](http://twitter.com/ramereth) and [Peter Krenesky](http://twitter.com/kreneskyp) will be giving a
tutorial talk on [Hands-on Virtualization with Ganeti](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/522). Open Source Bridge
runs June 21-24th.

We're also gearing up for [OSCON 2011](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011), but that's a story for July. We hope to see you
at Southeast LinuxFest, Open Source Bridge or both!
