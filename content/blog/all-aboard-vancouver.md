The OSUOSL Heads to LinuxCon North America 2011 Next Week

The entire [OSU Open Source Lab](/) team will be catching a ride on the
[Tux Bus](http://osuosl.org/about/news/students-linuxcon2011) next Monday, headed to Vancouver, B.C. and
[LinuxCon North America 2011](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon). We're very excited to be leading all
the sessions for the brand new [Linux Learners Day](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon/student-program),
a full day of talks geared to students. The schedule includes:

- Fundamentals of Open Source Development
- Linux Basics
- Introduction to Python
- Embedded Systems
- Careers in Open Source

Linux Learners Day is one of the many ways the [Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/) supports students in
pursuit of future careers in the Linux arena. Other efforts include
[Linux Training Scholarships](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2011/08/linux-foundation-announces-linux-training-scholarship-recipients),
with the first round of scholarship recipients announced just yesterday.

We'll also be at LinuxCon the rest of the week to enjoy the sessions and the company of our fellow Linux and open source
enthusiasts. While we're looking forward to many of the talks, we're particularly looking forward to our very own
[Lance Albertson](http://twitter.com/ramereth) presenting on
[Hosting Open Source Projects at the OSUOSL](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon/albertson).

[Registration](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon/register) is still open for Linux Learners Day and
LinuxCon, so if you haven't made arrangements to join us, there's still time to do so. Hope to see you in Vancouver!
