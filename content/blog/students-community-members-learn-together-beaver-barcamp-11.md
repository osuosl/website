**More than 150 Oregon State students, community members and students from other
Oregon universities gathered in the Kelley Engineering building April 20 to
attend the Open Source Lab’s Beaver BarCamp 11. Attendees presented nearly 50
sessions on a wide range of topics ranging from the technical to the
recreational, including successful system administration, mead brewing and how
to turn a T-shirt into a tie.**

The open, supportive atmosphere found at Beaver BarCamp encourages students and
community members to come together, share what they know and learn from each
other. After OSL Director Lance Albertson’s welcome speech, Beaver BarCamp
participants created the schedule together, adding session titles to the board
on large Post-it notes.

Sessions can be changed and added throughout the day, a feature participants
took full advantage of as sessions were juggled to meet group interest in
particular topics. When a session on Raspberry Pi single-board computers
presented by Ken Olsen, a software technician at Hewlett-Packard, outgrew the
room it was assigned to, the group moved to a larger room and a second Raspberry
Pi session was added to the schedule.

  > “I like the informal quality of it because it’s open, it’s casual, it’s
  > inviting,” says Nate Robison, a senior studying computer science at Western
  > Oregon University.

Several sessions at Beaver BarCamp 11 were designed for beginners or to help
experienced coders expand their skills. Oregon State Ecampus student Bryon
Burleigh drove to Beaver BarCamp 11 from his home in Bend, Ore., hoping to
improve his coding skills. Burleigh is pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree in
computer science and appreciated the opportunity to learn about open source and
connect with fellow students.

  > “I want to learn about version control in person, and Beaver BarCamp gives me
  > a way to do that,” Burleigh says.

Beaver BarCamp encourages attendees not only to learn, but also to share their
knowledge. Because the unconference is open to everyone and doesn’t require
registration, it’s a great way for everyone from tech professionals to students
to share their passion and expertise.

Contributors may bring slides or visuals to illustrate their sessions, but a
formal presentation is not necessary. Oregon State senior David Fontenot, who is
studying computer science, enjoyed this aspect of Beaver BarCamp. During his
presentation, Emacs for Beginners, Fontenot spontaneously pulled up some of his
homework online in response to a question and showed attendees some step-by-step
techniques.

  > “I like teaching,” Fontenot says. “I recently started focusing on Emacs, and I
  > felt like I had something to contribute.”

interested in pursuing work as technology professionals to network with the
premiere career hub for jobs in the tech industry.

  > representing Dice. “We specifically want to support these students.”
