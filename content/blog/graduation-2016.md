As exciting as the end of the school year is for everyone, and with it the
promise of sun, no classes, shorts, extended vacations, and no classes, it also
brings an inevitable goodbye to those leaving to enter the real world.

I'm talking about our graduating seniors. Those who have earned their stripes
and are ready to move on. The superstars stepping up to take the stage. The
brave few willing to begin paying off their student loans. Many of our graduates
have spent multiple years working for the OSL, some starting not long after high
school. And we're losing too many good ones this year, including:

**Megan Goossens-Developer**

**Anthony Miller-Student Systems Engineer**

**Elsie Phillips-Project Manager**

**Sean Rettig-Student Systems Engineer**

**Lucy Wyman-Front End Engineer**

As sad as we are to see them go, we're so proud of everything our students have
accomplished and hope they only excel in their futures.

Word on the street is the feeling is mutual. Lucy Wyman says, "Graduating is
incredibly bittersweet, and the OSL is far and away the most valuable experience
I've had in college." The OSL is dedicated to mentoring its students beyond the
classroom. But their fresh eyes and innovation cannot be stressed enough. While
they learn from us, we're learning from them as well. Their experience is just
as valuable to us as we are to them.

We wish all our graduates the best of luck in their post Oregon State plans as
we wave a final farewell. Congratulations on your success!
