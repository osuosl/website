It's that time of year again in Portland, Oregon. It's sunny and warm - well, it
is today - and the annual [OSCON](http://oscon.com/) conference is just around the corner. 
The [OSU Open Source Lab](/) team will be participating in several activities at the
conference, and we hope to meet some new folks, introduce them to the lab and
our offerings to the open source community, and catch up with old friends.
Here's what we're up to at OSCON 2011:

Community Leadership Summit
---------------------------

Several team members will be attending the 
[Community Leadership Summit](http://communityleadershipsummit.com/) this
weekend, including our Director, [Curt Pederson](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4973150), 
our Lead Developer, [Peter Krenesky](http://twitter.com/kreneskyp), 
our Outreach Manager, [Leslie Hawthorn](http://twitter.com/lhawthorn) and our Public
Sector Communities Manager, [Deb Bryant](http://twitter.com/debbryant). We're 
looking forward to meeting up with our [fellow attendees](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/attendees/) 
and sharing collective knowledge about effective community care and feeding. 
[Registration](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/register/) is still open and 
admission is free of charge, so if you hadn't planned to attend, there's still time 
to change your mind!

Talks
-----

Our dynamic duo - Lead Systems Administrator/Architect 
[Lance Albertson](http://twitter.com/ramereth) and Peter Krenesky - will be 
holding two sessions at OSCON, one tutorial and one talk:

* Tutorial: [Hands on Virtualization with Ganeti](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18544), 
  Tuesday, July 26th at 1:30 PM in Room D139/D140
* Session: [Ganeti Web Manager: Cluster Management Made Simple](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18464), 
  Wednesday, July 27th at 4:10 PM in Room D136

You'll need to have [registered](https://en.oreilly.com/oscon2011/public/register) 
to attend the tutorial, but the talk is open to all those who have an OSCON sessions pass.

Expo Hall
---------

Come visit us at Booth 218 in Expo Hall D. We'll be demoing our home grown open
source project, [Ganeti Web Manager](http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr), 
and giving the community updates about our Supercell testing cluster. 
Better still, we have awesome new OSL swag to hand out. But wait, there's more - 
our stellar student employees will be on hand to talk about their roles at the OSL, 
the projects they're working on and how the OSL has better prepared them for their 
future careers in industry. Make sure to stop by!

Puppet Labs Party
-----------------

Our friends at [Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) have graciously invited 
us to attend their party and tell attendees more about the OSL. Attendees 
will be treated to free libations served in OSL beer mugs. Join us at Puppet Labs' 
HQ in the Pearl District at 8:00 PM on Tuesday, July 26th. No registration is 
required to attend, and you can find full details, including address information,
[on the OSCON site](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/20865). 
The best part? You get to keep the awesome mug. Thanks once again to Puppet Labs 
for inviting us to be part of their soiree!

We're looking forward to seeing you at these events or just hanging out with you
in the hallway track!
