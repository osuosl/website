Spring is almost here, and that means Beaver BarCamp 15 is quickly approaching. The OSL's annual unconference is
scheduled for Saturday, April 18th. Participants are beginning to gather ideas and information for their sessions, and
the Open Source Lab is offering up some helpful suggestions on how to present a successful unconference session:

1. Plan ahead. While the spirit of BarCamp is spontaneous and unstructured, it is a good idea to gather enough
   information ahead of time to present a well-informed BarCamp presentation. Planning for your session can help you
   budget your time and make you less nervous.

2. Interactivity. One of the reasons unconferences can be valuable is the possibility of collaborative and interactive
   sessions. A formal lecture can be restrictive, and can discourage active learning. Include the audience in your
   sessions. Ask them questions in order to gauge their experience level. Engage the audience in activities and
   demonstrations. This can lead to a more beneficial session for everyone.

3. Angle. Itâ€™s always a good idea to establish a position, or an angle, on a session topic. It increases opportunity for
   conversation, and gives a good foundation for formatting a session. However, it is important to be ready for others
   to disagree with your position, and be prepared to listen to their point of view. Avoid getting too defensive about
   your position on the topic.

4. Visual aids help. Visual aids, whether it is a slideshow, a demonstration or simply an image, are good tools to
   illustrate your presentation and increase audience interest. It also serves as a discussion point if you get lost or
   stuck during your session. Be sure to test your visual aids ahead of time in order to make sure everything is saved
   and working properly.

5. Don't be afraid of a smaller session. While popular sessions can be satisfying, smaller sessions allow for more
   discussion and exchanging of ideas. Having a small session does not mean you are unsuccessful!

6. Diversity. Beaver BarCamp sessions do not have to be tech-based, and attendees are encouraged to present a wide
   variety of session topics. Some examples of past topics include Python programming, Zumba, Heartbleed, helicopters
   and Magic: The Gathering. The diverse session topics add to the unconference, and presenters should run sessions
   about what interests them, making for a more interesting and better presented talk.

Beaver BarCamp is free and open to students and community members alike. To learn more about Beaver BarCamp, please
