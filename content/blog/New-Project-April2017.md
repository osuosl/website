![New Project: libpng Now Mirrored on ftp.osuosl.org](/images/NewProjectAdjustedImage.png#blog)

The OSL took on a new project and delivers a new
[mirroring site libpng source](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) for libpng tarball distributions that is 20+
times as fast as the old site. It also now responds to http and https requests as well as ftp requests. For more
information and links, see the [original announcement](https://sourceforge.net/p/png-mng/mailman/message/35801076/).
