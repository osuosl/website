**The Open Source Lab (OSL) recently kicked off its 10 year celebration at the O’Reilly Open Source Conference in
Portland July 23 - 26.**

Over the last decade, the OSL has contributed much to the recent growth of the open source community and is using this
milestone to reflect on its past accomplishments and to create goals for the future. By focusing to ‘Build The Future’
in three key areas: education, outreach, and research and infrastructure, the lab will strengthen its position as an
open source leader.

“It’s an important milestone," says OSL Director Lance Albertson. "We’re not just a small group of people anymore but a
maturing organization with a smart staff of both students and non-students."

infrastructure.

Further enabling the lab to expand its emphasis on education and fulfill its mission to promote open source technology
globally, the OSL recently joined Oregon State’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This
joint effort will help the OSL and the EECS to expand open source curriculum, mentor an increasing number of students
and promote open source technologies in the public sector.

“It's exciting to see everybody having positive feedback for us moving into EECS," Albertson says. "Becoming part of the
EECS department will enable us to reach out to more students interested in FOSS (free open source software) or the OSL
than we normally do. Sky’s the limit on what we are capable of doing with this migration.”

One of the many ways the OSL promotes open source education is by attending conferences, and as one of the largest open
source conferences, OSCON provides many avenues to do so with over 3,900 attendees and 100-plus company booths. At the
conference, the OSL hosted a booth in the nonprofit pavillion, and students and staff enjoyed interacting with members
of the open source community.

“OSCON was awesome," OSL Student Developer Geoff Corey says. "It was fun working the booth and telling people from
different backgrounds what exactly we do at the OSL”.

"Hosted by the OSL" signs for the OSL's hosted communities.

The OSL handed out placards to the many open source projects hosted by the lab that also had booths in the OSCON expo
hall, visually demonstrating the impact the lab has on the open source community. In addition, several community members
stopped by to meet the students and staff that support their projects, facilitate their downloads, or provide technical
help.

Corey thought “it was pretty cool how many big companies knew about us and our many services we provide to people showed
how big our impact really is in the open source community”.

On Tuesday night of the conference, the lab hosted an alumni party in appreciation of the students and staff that have
contributed to the lab’s success with 50 guests showing up. Celebrating the OSL’s 10 year celebration, the OSL provided
food along with a slideshow displaying the history of the lab and Squishymedia generously donated the use of their
office space in downtown Portland to help in the party efforts. The atmosphere felt like a family reunion, as old
friends reconnected and new employees were welcomed.

OSL Director, Lance Albertson, and past OSL Project Manager, Greg Lund-Chaix, speak about the history of the OSL at the
alumni party hosted at [Squishymedia](http://squishymedia.com/).

“Once you are a part of the OSL, you are always a part of it,” says Greg Lund-Chaix, Squishymedia tech lead and former
OSL project manager. “I still use ‘we’ when I refer to the lab.”

According to Albertson, the slideshow made him think about what it took to create the OSL.

"The OSL became what it is because we had the right connections, opportunities, people, and sponsors at the right time,"
Albertson says.
