The Drupal Association is supporting the Oregon State University Open Source Lab to the tune of $15,000. Specifically,
$10,000 is being directed specifically towards paying OSL student employees to work on drupal.org infrastructure tasks.
Our students have been instrumental in setting up and maintaining the infrastructure for drupal.org and related sites,
and we are very excited to be able to dedicate more time to this important project.

Additionally, the Drupal Association has committed to make a $5,000 donation to the Open Source Lab general fund. This
money is used to support all of our activities at the OSL, for specifics, please see our [FAQ](/faq). It is great to see
a project hosted at the OSL become large enough that they are able to support the Lab with a monetary donation,
especially as we celebrate our sixth anniversary with the [Give 6](/donate/buildthefuture) program.
