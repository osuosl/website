This year will be the lab's seventh straight as a GSOC mentor.

Open Source Lab staff are excited to announce that the lab has been accepted as
a Google Summer of Code mentoring organization for the seventh year running.
GSoC is a valuable opportunity for collaboration between the lab and young
programmers around the world. In the past, the lab has worked with students from
China, Portugal, Venezuela and Poland, offering them mentorship and guidance as
they complete tasks to advance projects at the OSL.

This year, the lab has several development projects available for GSoC students
to apply their skills to. As mentors, lab staff members strive to support
student learning and offer an experience that will improve their future work in
a number of contexts.

“GSoC exposes young programmers to real-world development and introduces them
into the open source community,” says Ken Lett, an OSL developer who mentored
the lab’s 2012 GSoC student. “Being able to contribute real and useful code to
real projects can be a very inspiring experience, and working on projects with
professional standards and development processes will be useful for their own
careers.”
