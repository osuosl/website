It's not an overstatement to say that Gentoo was integral to the Open Source
Lab’s foundation. The Linux-based operating system was one of the OSL's first
projects - it even preceded the existence of the lab - and was instrumental in
building the buzz that put open source at OSU on the map.

It started when Gentoo reached out to the open source community for help - it
needed more infrastructure, and OSU provided it. "Web services donated an old
Dell server, and from there Gentoo just grew and grew," says Lance Albertson,
lead Unix systems administrator at the OSL.

Gentoo, which was already popular with the open source community at OSU, is an
ideal system for many developers because it allows them to install their own
meta-distribution. Everyone who uses Gentoo can compile his or her own code,
making it extremely flexible and customizable. "The community thought, 'if OSU
is using Gentoo, it must be good,'" says Albertson.

Word-of-mouth brought OSU enough attention to be covered in Slashdot.org, the
site that bills itself as "News for Nerds." As more people learned about OSU's
hosting capabilities, more people reached out to its open source community - and
the Lab's reputation was born.

"The OSL is unique," says Donnie Berkholz, an OSU graduate student in
biochemistry and biophysics, and a member of Gentoo's leadership. "They help out
these nonprofit projects when there's no one else who would provide these
services without charging a lot of money we don’t have."

Without the OSL's hosting capabilities, projects like Gentoo would have to scale
back to the point that service to developers would disappear, or degrade to the
point where it’s too hard for developers to work with.

"Most universities will host a couple of boxes for you, but trying to coordinate
among them is difficult," says Albertson. "At the OSL hosting these machines is
a top priority."
