The Oregon State University Open Source Lab recently received a large gift
in-kind donation from a local Portland company which included approximately 20
servers, two NetApp filers with approximately 14TB of disk space, load
balancers, and more. This is a very generous donation which will help the OSL
replace aging hardware and expand our current infrastructure to support even
more services and open source projects.

One of the donated servers (pictured here), an HP dl580 with 20GB of RAM and
dual dual-core Xeon processors has already been put to use as a community
database server. The OSL is currently running five such servers which run MySQL
and PostgreSQL databases for our hosted partners. Our database servers power
such community sites as [phpBB](http://phpbb.com/), [Mozillazine](http://mozillazine.org/), [Linux Plumbers Conference](http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/),
[OpenOffice Extensions](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/), [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/), [Gentoo Forums](http://forums.gentoo.org/), [Kerneltrap](http://kerneltrap.org/),
[OLPC Support Forums](http://en.forum.laptop.org/), and many more!

We're excited and very gracious for the hardware donation, and we already have
many plans for the new hardware! Can you help the OSL by making a monetary or
in-kind contribution? See [osuosl.org/donate](/donate) for more information.
