## Service(s) affected

All VMs running on our production Ganeti cluster will need to be non-live migrated to their secondary nodes (i.e.
shutdown and start is required). We expect the outages for each VM to be short (under 5 minutes each). To see a list of
VMs that are affected and when please see this [page](https://goo.gl/QEQsyu). We will ensure the VMs are pingable after
the reboot, but you may want to check that services started properly for any services we don't already monitor.

No OpenStack services will be affected by this outage.

## Outage Window

This is a multi-day outage which will impact one hypervisor per day with an outage window of approximately two hours. If
we run into an issue that can't be resolved during the day of the planned outage, we will be pushing back this schedule
a day and notify you of the change.

### Currently proposed schedule for the hypervisors

- gprod6: 12/11/2017 9:00AM - 11:00 AM PST (1700 - 1900 UTC)
- gprod4: 12/12/2017 9:00AM - 11:00 AM PST (1700 - 1900 UTC)
- gprod3: 12/13/2017 9:00AM - 11:00 AM PST (1700 - 1900 UTC)
- gprod7: 12/14/2017 9:00AM - 11:00 AM PST (1700 - 1900 UTC)
- gprod2: 12/15/2017 9:00AM - 12:00 PM PST (1700 - 2000 UTC)
- gprod1: 12/18/2017 1:00PM - 3:00 PM PST (2100 - 2300 UTC)
- gprod8: 12/19/2017 9:00AM - 11:00 AM PST (1700 - 1900 UTC)

## Reason for outage

We're in the midst of rebuilding our Ganeti clusters to CentOS 7 and managed via Chef. We finished our rebuild of the
internal cluster this week and are ready to proceed with rebuilding our production cluster. We have a total of 8
hypervisors in this cluster, one of which has already been migrated to Chef. All secondary instances attached to the
affected node will remain and be re-synced once the node has been rebuilt and added back as a node. All VM data stored
on nodes will remain intact during the rebuild as only the OS partition will be rebuilt.

To minimize the impact of outages, we're going to ensure all VMs will be migrated to a new Chef managed node so that we
do not need to do another downtime. Once all hosts have been migrated, we'll be re-balance the cluster and use
live-migration to move VMs so that no downtime will be noticed. We cannot use live-migration during the migration due to
KVM version differences between the new and old hosts unfortunately. We're also going to take advantage of this downtime
to replace the RAID batteries on these nodes.

If you have any questions or concerns please let us know.

Please check <http://status.osuosl.org/> for any future updates to this planned outage.

## Projects affected

All hosted VMs on our production Ganeti cluster.
