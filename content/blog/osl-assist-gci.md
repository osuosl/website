CORVALLIS, Ore. - High school students can soon participate in the
[Google Code-in Contest](http://code.google.com/gci) with the assistance of the [Open Source Lab](/) at
Oregon State University.

In this contest, which begins Nov. 22, students aged 13-18 will be provided with
a list of tasks that could improve various open source software projects. The
OSU Open Source Lab, one of 20 organizations participating in this initiative,
will ask students to create logo artwork, write code, produce documentation, fix
software glitches and do other tasks.

Students do not need to have prior programming experience to complete many of the
contest tasks.

“We are excited to participate in the Google Code-in contest,” said Jeff
Sheltren, operations manager for the OSU Open Source Lab. “We’ve mentored
university students in open source development for the past five years in
[Google's Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc) program and had great success. We look forward to
helping high school students engage with open source software projects and
communities.”

This project is one of several K-12 educational initiatives the lab participates
in, including the Oregon Virtual School District and the TeachEngineering
Project.

In the Google Code-in Contest, successful participants will receive a T-shirt
from Google and have the opportunity to win up to $500 for their submissions.
