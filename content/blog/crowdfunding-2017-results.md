As of September 1, the OSL has concluded its first ever crowdfunding campaign. With the support of our donors and the
larger open source community, we managed to raise **$7,140** to support our students here at the lab in compensating
them for their work and enriching their experience through events such as [Beaver Barcamp](http://beaverbarcamp.org/)
and other conferences.

We are so very thankful for the support of our partners and friends. If you would like to donate to the OSL, visit our
[donation page](http://osuosl.org/donate/) or our
[OSU Foundation page](https://securelb.imodules.com/s/359/foundation/index.aspx?sid=359&gid=34&pgid=1982&bledit=1&cid=3007&dids=79)
to make a direct donation. And follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OSUOSL/),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/osuosl), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/osuosl/) to hear about more fundraising
opportunities we hold in the future.

Thank you!
