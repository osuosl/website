![Changing the World, One Line of Code at a Time](/images/OSLWorkers2Adjusted.jpg#blog)

The [OSU Experience Site](http://experience.oregonstate.edu/) has published an online
[article](http://experience.oregonstate.edu/feature-story/changing-world-one-line-code-time) about our students! In it
they talk about the services we provide, our positive impact on the lives of our student workers, and the industries we
work with.
