#. **2003/04 Mozilla Firefox** |br|
   The OSL began hosting the Mozilla Foundation in 2003. In 2004, the lab
   began facilitating downloads of the Mozilla web browser Firefox 1.0, using
   Bouncer. The OSL specifically created Bouncer to help facilitate the high
   number of Firefox downloads: over 1 million on the first day of its
   release. `Learn more`__

#. **2005 Google and TDS** |br|
   In 2005, TDS donated 600 megabits of Internet bandwidth, enabling the OSL
   to improve its FTP mirroring services. Google also began donating to the
   Lab on a regular basis, ensuring the Lab’s success in contributing to the
   open source community. `Learn more`__

#. **2007 One Laptop per Child** |br|
   When representatives from RealNetworks visited the OSL in 2007, they were
   impressed with the quality of work OSL students Michael Burns and Justin
   Gallardo had completed on One Laptop per Child and with their passion for
   open source projects. Burns and Gallardo credited energy drinks and pizza
   with aiding their efforts. `Learn more`__

#. **2008 First Beaver BarCamp** |br|
   After attending BarCamp Portland, former OSL student employee Alex Polvi
   convinced Associate Professor Timothy Budd to help him create Beaver
   BarCamp, an open, informal conference. Now in its fifth year, Beaver
   BarCamp has expanded to include non-tech sessions. `Learn more`__

#. **2010 Ganeti Web Manager** |br|
   Ganeti Web Manager is a Web application developed at the OSL that allows
   administrators and clients access to administer and use Google’s open
   source cloud infrastructure. GWM also trains students working at the Lab in
   software and infrastructure development.

   “It gives our students partially real-world experience working on a
   project, similar to what they might get down the road working for a
   company, where they might inherit code and have to work with what they’ve
   been given,” OSL Director Lance Albertson says.

#. **2011 Drupal 7** |br|
   The OSL began hosting Drupal’s servers in 2005, helping Drupal to expand
   along with its growing community of users. In 2011, Drupal celebrated its
   tenth anniversary and Drupal.org was redesigned with the help of the OSL
   and former OSL employees. In addition, Drupal 7 was released and Drupal.org
   migrated to the Git version control system. `Learn more`__

#. **2012 Expanding with new projects: Python Software Foundation and
   Systers** |br|
   A growing, high-impact project used extensively at the OSL, the Python
   Software Foundation needed more centralized hosting and chose the OSL.
   Currently, the lab is moving various Python services to the OSL-managed
   cloud. In addition, the OSL began hosting Systers, an email community
   promoting women in computing, as part of the Lab’s expanding outreach
   efforts.

   “We encourage diversity in all forms including encouraging women in the
   tech industry,” Albertson says. “We wanted to ensure Systers was on stable
   footing to continue to grow as a project and a community.”

#. **2013 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** |br|
   In August, the OSL joined the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
   Science at Oregon State in order to enhance its ability to mentor students
   and promote open source education.

   In addition, the OSL began celebrating a decade of open source hosting,
   development and education. By focusing on three key areas—education,
   outreach, and research and infrastructure—the OSL is taking the lead to
   build the future of the open source community. `Learn more`__
