The Oregon State University Open Source Lab was recently featured in a Network World online story about really cool
university computer network labs. This is a great honor for us, and we are glad to be in such good company. Some of the
highlights of the OSUOSL included in the list were our hosting of projects such as the
[Linux Kernel](http://kernel.org/), [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), the [Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/),
our development work on the [Oregon Virtual School District](http://orvsd.org/), and our annual
[Government Open Source Conference](http://goscon.org/).
