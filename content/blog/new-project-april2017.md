The OSL took on a new project and delivers a new 
[mirroring site libpng source](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
for libpng tarball distributions that is 20+ times as fast as the old site. It
also now responds to http and https requests as well as ftp requests. For more
information and links, see the 
[original announcement](https://sourceforge.net/p/png-mng/mailman/message/35801076/).
