Open Source Lab staff members attended [DrupalCon](https://portland2013.drupal.org/) May 20-24 at the Oregon
Convention Center in Portland. OSL attendees welcomed the opportunity to
contribute and learn during the many sessions and social events.

“It was so good to see everyone in the open source community, meet new people
and reconnect with people I only see once a year,” says Rudy Grigar, senior
systems architect.

The OSL presented
[Put the Ops in Dev: What Developers Need to Know about Devops](https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/put-ops-dev-what-developers-need-know-about-devops), a session to
teach developers what they need to know about operations to improve the
maintainability of their code in production. Grigar said that the session was
fun to present, because they had good participation.

“We had lots of good questions at the end of the session from the Drupal
community,” Grigar says.

Another session presented by the OSL was
[Empowering K-12 Schools through Drupal and other FOSS Tools](https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3373). Greg Lund-Chaix,
a former OSL developer who was instrumental in the creation of the `Oregon
Virtual School District`_, discussed how ORVSD benefits Oregon teachers and
school districts. Lund-Chaix explained that ORVSD is a resource teachers can use
to supplement their in-class instruction but is not designed to replace
classroom teachers or provide high school credit.

“This is a tool to do better, not a tool to do more,” Lund-Chaix says.

In addition, OSL Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett discussed the ways ORVSD is
currently being utilized by school districts and fielded audience questions.

In the expo hall, OSL Director Lance Albertson was pleased to see the wide
variety of technology companies using Drupal, which has been hosted at the OSL
since 2005.

“I thought it was amazing to see the different designs, deployments and unique
ways Drupal is being used,” Albertson says.

For example, [Videx](http://www.videx.com/), an access control and data collection company located in
Corvallis, uses Drupal as the basis for their electronic lock systems. The
diversity of companies using Drupal demonstrates the popularity of the content
management system and its continued growth.

The OSL would like to thank the many Drupalcon event sponsors.
