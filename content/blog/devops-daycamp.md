The Open Source Lab will host the new DevOps DayCamp on Saturday, October 11, in the Kelley Engineering Center from 9
a.m. until 6 p.m. The event is free and open to the public.

DevOps DayCamp will kick off DevOps BootCamp, allowing students to start their DevOps education early in the school
year. In order to accommodate different experience levels, DayCamp is comprised of two tracks: a beginner track and an
advanced track. The beginner track will help inexperienced attendees get started with DevOps through introductory
sessions and workshops on the basics of DevOps. Additionally, the advanced track will be comprised of a hands-on
hackathon with educational sessions throughout the day for the more experienced DevOps crowd. Advanced track sessions
will be given by industry professionals and will include Ansible, Travis CI and Docker.

The OSL is hosting DevOps DayCamp instead of the fall [Beaver Barcamp](http://beaverbarcamp.org/). Due to the tight
academic calendar, as well as the amount of organizing a successful Barcamp entails, Beaver Barcamp is now an annual
event held in the Spring.

“This year we decided that it was best to switch to a once a year format and focus on making Beaver Barcamp better,"
says Lance Albertson, director of the Open Source Lab. “We also look forward to developing new education programs such
as a hackathon focused on DevOps and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), getting students interested in it early on in
their school year.”

Registration and more information about DevOps DayCamp is available on the
