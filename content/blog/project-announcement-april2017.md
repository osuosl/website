In July 2017, the OSL began providing virtual machine and database for hosting
the demo service of polr. The project itself simplifies long and complicated
urls. It was started by a high school student back in 2014 who has since
volunteered on the Fedora Infrastructure team. For more information, visit the
[project website](https://polrproject.org/).
