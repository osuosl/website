Over 100 students and community members attended the Open Source Lab’s DevOps
DayCamp in the Kelley Engineering Center at Oregon State University on Saturday,
Oct. 11.

DevOps DayCamp, a new event this year, was the kick-off for DevOps BootCamp, an
extracurricular training program in its second year that takes place throughout
the school year for OSU students and community members interested in DevOps.
DayCamp is a dual-track event designed to accommodate varying levels of DevOps
experience. Tracks consisted of a beginner track and an advanced track, with one
joint session for all experience levels.

The beginner track guided less experienced attendees in getting started through
introductory and workshop sessions on the basics of DevOps. Led by the OSL
staff, beginner attendees received instruction on some basic tools of DevOps,
including Linux, the terminal and IRC. The sessions set beginners up for a
successful DevOps BootCamp experience.

Computer science student Anna Murphy, a beginner, says, “It was pretty intense,
but as fast as it went it was still manageable. At the end of the day I was
amazed by how much I had managed to learn. I kept thinking that I wish they had
told me this in one of my classes.”

Advanced track sessions covered tools useful in DevOps. Talks were given by
industry professionals, and included Ansible, Travis CI and Docker. Sessions
were lecture-based, but also provided time to workshop and gain hands-on
experience.

OSL system administrator Daniel Takamori delivered a presentation on Docker in
the advanced track. “It was great fun and I would love to do it again. The two
sides of tracks were great. The wide variety of experience was neat to interact
with.”

Nike presented a joint session talk about how DevOps is used in a corporate
setting. The joint session covered topics including DevOps culture, continuous
integration and deployment, cloud architecture, cloud security and what DevOps
is like within Nike.

Murphy felt it was a valuable experience to extend her education. “It felt like
I had a better understanding of what tools were used in the industry and how to
access them,” Murphy says.

DevOps BootCamp takes place on Mondays from 7-9pm in the Kelley Engineering
Center. Check out the [website](http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/) for more information!
