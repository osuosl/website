![DevOps Bootcamp Extends OSL Reach](/images/dobc-extends-osl-reach.jpg#blog)

Sometimes, it’s hard to be popular. The increasing popularity of open source
means that there are always more students interested in the Open Source Lab than
we have the ability to hire and mentor. In order to increase the lab’s reach and
educate more people about FOSS, the lab created a new program, DevOps Bootcamp.
Spearheaded by Emily Dunham, a student system administrator, and modeled after
Portland State University’s [Braindump](http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu/braindump/), 
this program will allow more people from outside of the OSL to learn valuable FOSS skills.

The unique DevOps Bootcamp curriculum focuses on both software development and
systems administration. Designed to be accessible to complete beginners, the
course aims to take potential open source contributors from no knowledge to a
solid grasp of the basics in a year. The informal class covers the following key
areas: linux basics, basic system administration, basic FOSS development
methodologies, base infrastructure services for any organization (DNS, Email,
etc), and building a simulated infrastructure for a company from top to bottom.

Dunham, who also worked as a teaching assistant, feels she is gaining valuable
experience sharing her expertise with new people.

“Because it’s the first time we’re offering this class, it’s a learning
experience for everyone,” says Dunham. “I’m learning as much about how to teach
as they are learning about devops.”

DevOps Bootcamp is held on Thursdays from 6-8 pm and is open to anyone in the
community. Not only is the course about open source, the course itself is open
source. The curriculum, based on the [Computer Science 312](/students/cs312/) course the lab
taught in 2009, is available on the DevOps Bootcamp website. In addition,
[Youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzbgtiNz4A7mrOdSWNICSbYuJOG4j4yW&feature=mh_lolz) 
of the classes are posted online and students can ask questions on IRC 
(#devopsbootcamp on freenode). The first meeting was successful, 
with 34 people in attendance.

“I’m really happy with the number of people that weren’t just sitting there,”
says Dunham. “They asked questions and demonstrated that they were engaged and
participating.”
