[CrisisCommons](http://crisiscommons.org/) is a global network of volunteers who use creative problem solving and open
technologies to help people and communities in times and places of crisis. CrisisCommons is pleased to join several
other humanitarian free and open source software projects hosted by [Oregon State University's Open Source Lab](/)
(OSL).

The CrisisCommons community creates “[CrisisCamp](http://crisiscommons.org/crisiscamp/)” events where volunteers of all
skill levels can work across borders, languages and timezones to collaborate on projects, translate languages, build
open source technology tools, and aggregate data to provide support for crisis response efforts. During the worldwide
response to the Haiti and Chile earthquakes, this community organized 63 events across 8 countries with over 2,300
people participating to support such projects as [Person Finder](http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Person_Finder), a
searchable database of missing persons, and [Tradui](http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Tradui), the first Creole
translation application. The OSL has been part of the CrisisCommons community from the beginning, through the CrisisCamp
Portland ([CrisisCampPDX](http://osuosl.org/about/news/crisiscamphaiti_pdx)) event on January 23, 2010.

Born from the adversity of the Haiti event, a grass roots CrisisCommons community emerged and grew throughout 2010. We
supported technology work on crisis events throughout the year, including the Tennessee Floods, Gulf Oil Spill, and
Pakistan Floods. We hosted the First International Crisis Congress in July, 2010, in Washington DC, which convened
CrisisCamp city leads, experts in disaster management, and partners in the public and private sector together to outline
our goals and agenda for the commons community. Our OSL partnership continued here too, as
[Deb Bryant](http://twitter.com/debbryant), Public Sector Communities Manager for the OSL, was part of our Congress, and
has been a key advisor to CrisisCommons ever since.

One key goal global of CrisisCommons is to develop a commons-based approach to crisis management and global development
that spans public and private sectors, NGO/NPO's, and other Volunteer Technology Communities (VTCs). We seek to do this
by leveraging, supporting, or building through an openness mele of open source, open data, and open standards, and by
exploring a research-based agenda to technology applicability in a crisis.

Since the Congress, the community has been actively working on a foundation grant to continue its growth, and move
beyond a grass-roots community. We are pleased to announce that the
[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/) has awarded a two-year, $1.2 million
grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/) to support the development of CrisisCommons.
CrisisCommons will be funded for 2 years under the Wilson center to continue our work.

A key step in this process is establishing a solid infrastructure to support our CrisisCommons community activities,
hence why we are excited to expand our partnership formally with the OSL. We are delighted to be able to learn from
experts in open source communities and provide scalable and reliable resources for CrisisCamp technology innovation and
response efforts.

Our work with the OSL will focus on the following areas:

- Hosting and support of core CrisisCommons services, including our websites, wikis, and other community and
  knowledge/training resources for commons/community steady-state operations
- Establishing foundational model for Crisis/Disaster based lab and research based open source projects to support
  technology innovation in this space
- Establishing a model for specific crisis/disaster response technology hosting that are needed in a disaster event
  (surge capacity model)

We are still new to this, and have so much to learn from the OSL and their wider partner community, but are excited to
start our journey. We look forward to joining OSL and becoming a successful
[HFOSS project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFOSS) under their stewardship. One more forward step together toward
lessoning human suffering in the world, and achieving opportunity for good through adversity.

Looking forward to the future,

Deborah Shaddon
