The Oregon State University Open Source Lab is proud to be the new home for two
very important OSS projects. We are now hosting the main web sites, ticket
trackers, code repositories, and mailing lists for RPM and yum.

[RPM](http://rpm.org/) is the package management system used by many Linux distributions
including RedHat Enterprise, Fedora, SUSE, CentOS, Mandriva, and many others.
The RPM format is also part of the [Linux Standards Base](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Specifications).

[Yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/) is a package installer/remover for RPM-based systems, and does all the
work to calculate dependencies for packages that you want to install or remove.
Yum is the default package manager for RedHat Enterprise, Fedora and CentOS
Linux distributions. In addition to yum, the OSUOSL is also hosting development
sites for yum-utils, a collection of utilities and scripts built around yum, and
createrepo, the program which creates metadata used in package repositories
(supported by yum, apt-rpm, red-carpet, smart, up2date, and yast).

The sites for RPM and yum can be found at http://rpm.org and
http://yum.baseurl.org, respectively.
