Last month, Oregon State University Open Source Lab Operations Manager, Jeff Sheltren, headed to Chicago for
[Flourish! Open Source Conference](http://www.flourishconf.com), put on by the University of Illinois, Chicago. There
was a great crowd at Flourish with a number of excellent speakers and demonstration/learning sessions going on
throughout the two day conference.

Jeff spoke about the OSUOSL including the history, current projects, and some of the cool open source projects hosted at
the lab. There was a lot of interest in the audience about forming open source groups at other universities and
potential collaboration with the OSUOSL.

Flourish plans to make video of Jeff's talk (and all of the other speakers!) available on their website in the near
future. In the meantime, you can find Jeff's presentation on the OSUOSL here (odp format[expired]; pdf format[expired]).
