   **The OSL Team and Our Host, David Recordon, at Facebook's Prineville Data
   Center**

We've been spending the past few weeks making our plans for the summer: specing
out longer term projects for our student employees, sharing our knowledge at
conferences and continuing our mission to grow and support the world of open
source. While we're busy looking forward and reviewing our progress thus far for
2011, we thought it would be the perfect time to bring the community an update
on what we've been up to for the past few months since our [last newsletter](/blog/osl-newsletter-look-back-2010).
If you'd like to receive more frequent news updates from the OSL,
[follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/osuosl) or [find us on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/OSUOSL).

Thanks to Our Sponsors
----------------------

Before we share our good news, we want to take a moment to express our sincerest
thanks to our sponsors. Without the support of our generous donors, the OSL
would not be able to provide support and services to our [hosted communities](/communities).
If you or your company would like to join our list of supporters, please visit
our [Donations information page](/donate).

It's always wonderful to see the successes of the OSL's alums, and we've seen
many of our former student employees go on to great things: founding their own
startups, opening boutique consulting shops and landing roles at high profile
open source companies like Mozilla. We're particularly proud of one of the lab's
first student employees, [Alex Polvi](http://twitter.com/polvi), whose company
[Cloudkick was recently acquired by Rackspace](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/news/stories/cloudkick.html). In true open source fashion,
Alex has given back to the lab through his Silver sponsorship of the OSL and
sharing his infectious enthusiasm for our plans to create open source boot camps
at Oregon State University. Many thanks to Alex for his support and our best
wishes for all his future endeavors.

Our friends at the [CiviCRM](http://civicrm.org/) project have once again joined us as Bronze
sponsors for 2011. One of the best parts of our job at the OSL is providing
support to the many open source projects that empower other organizations to do
their good work, and CiviCRM does just that by providing constituent management
software for advocacy, non-profit and non-governmental groups. We are proud to
host CiviCRM and send our thanks to them for their continued support.

Finally, a **great big thank you** to Google. Google has renewed their Platinum
sponsorship in the lab for 2011, continuing their tradition of support for the
lab since its inception. Google has donated more than one million dollars to the
OSL and we are grateful for their generous support and the opportunity to
participate in its open source programs for students, [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/)
and [Google Code-In](http://code.google.com/gci).

Facebook, the OSL and Supercell
-------------------------------

The entire OSL crew was recently invited to tour Facebook's
[Open Compute Data Center](http://opencompute.org/) in Prineville, Oregon. Needless to say, it was an
incredible experience for the team. You can read all about our adventure and see
more photos from the data center on the OSL news page.

You may recall our recent announcement of the Supercell project, our new on
demand virtualization and continuous integration resource, made possible by a
generous grant from Facebook's Open Source Team. Our early testers are up and
running on Supercell and our first report from the field has come in from the
Drupal project. You can learn more about Drupal's use of Supercell
[on the blog](http://randyfay.com/node/99) of their stalwart Infrastructure Team member, [Randy Fay](http://twitter.com/randyfay).

We released the 0.6 version of [Ganeti Web Manager](http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr) in early March. This latest
release included several new features to support users of Supercell. You can

Events and Conferences
----------------------

We're looking forward to conference season going into full swing, and we're
excited to let you know that OSL employees will be speaking at several upcoming
events.

**LinuxCon NA 2011**

Our friends at [The Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/) have asked us to put together sessions on
Linux and open source for university students at the upcoming
[LinuxCon North America Conference](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon). Dubbed "Linux Learners Day," the track
will feature sessions on Fundamentals of Open Source, Linux Basics and Embedded
Systems. Keep your eye out for further announcements from the Linux Foundation
for the full schedule and spread the word to any university students you think
should join us! (And while you're at it, check out their two awesome design
contests on right now to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Linux, either on
video or emblazoned on cotton.)

**Open Source Conferences in Portland**

Portland is **the** town for open source conferences, and we're excited that our
employees will be speaking at the two preeminent events in Portland this year.
We hope to see you there!

had the opportunity to check them out, they're a wonderful way to learn more
about every day life at the OSL and how our students are gaining real-world
experience to prepare them for careers in industry. For your weekend reading

[Anthony Casson](http://twitter.com/ascasson):

We've recently hired a new crop of students at the OSL, and we look forward to
bringing you their stories in the coming months.
