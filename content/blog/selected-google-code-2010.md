We are thrilled to have been selected as mentoring organization for the
[Google Code-in contest](http://code.google.com/gci).

Right now, we're busy getting our task list up to date on the contest website, <http://google-melange.com>.

## News

Greg Lund-Chaix has written a blog post aimed at educators about why he's excited to participate as a mentor for Google
Code-in. Greg is one of the key figures behind the [Oregon Virtual School District](http://orvsd.org/) program.

## Student Information

Students can begin participating in the contest on
[November 22, 2010](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2010/timeline). In the interim,
now is a great time to peruse the
[Official Rules](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2010/rules) and the contest
[Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2010/faqs) pages. If you
want to talk your would-be mentors at the OSL, you can find us in our online chat room, #osuosl on Freenode.

If you are not familiar with using Internet Relay Chat (IRC), you may want to try using the web based client for our
chat room. Just visit <http://webchat.freenode.net> and then choose a nickname and type #osuosl into the Channels
textbox. Try to choose a nickname that is easy to understand; it is much easier for mentors to get to know you - and
take you seriously - if your online nickname is leslie or even giraffe rather than senoritasillypantalones.
