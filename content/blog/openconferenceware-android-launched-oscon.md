We are happy to announce that we've completed work on our
OpenConferenceware-Android application to make it available for OSCON 2010. You
can download the app to your Android phone to get access to OSCON schedule,
maps, and more.

Peter Krenesky, the lead developer of the Android application, has written a
blog post with more details about the application including links to the code.
You can also learn more from the [OSCON blog post](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/content/2010/07/12-oscon-android-app).

Developers may want to jump straight to the
[OpenConferenceWare-Android project site](http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ocw-android).

Heard enough and want to install it on your phone already? Either search for
'OSCON' in the Android Market, or you can scan the QR code above with your
phone.
