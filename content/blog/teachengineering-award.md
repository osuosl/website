At the annual meeting of the [National Science Digital Library](http://nsdl.org/) in Washington,
D.C. earlier this week, the [TeachEngineering digital library](http://www.teachengineering.org/) received a
“[recognition of excellence](http://ecadw.colorado.edu/enotes/nov10/#Headline_One)” award from NSDL. The NSDL is the
[National Science Foundation's](http://www.nsf.gov/) online library of resources and collections for
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and research.

At the opening of this year’s annual meeting, chair [Susan Jesuroga](http://expertvoices.nsdl.org/community/author/jesuroga/) recognized
the TeachEngineering collection as the most learning application-ready
collection in NSDL. The recognition was based on an audit of quality criteria
defined by NSDL as part of an assessment of the learning application readiness
of NSDL’s 121 collections.

TeachEngineering is a digital library of 900+ K-12 engineering lessons and
hands-on activities. The lesson materials are developed by a variety of
universities in collaboration with K-12 schools organizations and programs and
are made available free-of-charge to educators. The TeachEngineering initiative
is run by a collaboration of the University of Colorado at Boulder, Duke
University, Worcester Polytechnic University, Colorado School of Mines and
Oregon State University. The project is hosted at [OSU’s Open Source Lab](/).
