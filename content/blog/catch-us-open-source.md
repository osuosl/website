Open Source Bridge starts today and runs through Friday at the [Oregon Convention Center](http://oregoncc.org/) in
Portland, Oregon. Most of our full-time staff will be participating in the conference, so please stop us in the hallway
and say hi!

Deborah Bryant will be speaking on [Open Source in Government](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/269).

Lance Albertson will be speaking with ex-OSL'er, Narayan Newton (now at [Tag1 Consulting](http://tag1consulting.com/))
on [using "layers of caching" to scale websites](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/133).

Peter Krenesky will be leading our open in government hackathon session at the Hilton Portland & Executive Tower.

Greg Lund-Chaix and Jeff Sheltren will be around to enjoy the conference and talk to people about what's going on at the
Open Source Lab.
