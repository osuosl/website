As part a major effort and plan by the worldwide Nokia (Mameo project) and Intel (Moblin project) to share the MeeGo
operating system code with the open source community, MeeGo has selected OSU's Open Source Lab as its infrastructure
home. Today MeeGo is an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation that encourages community contributions in
accordance with the best practices of the open source development model.

MeeGo is an open source, Linux project which brings together the Moblin project, headed up by Intel, and Maemo, by
Nokia, into a single open source activity. MeeGo integrates the experience and skills of two significant development
ecosystems, versed in communications and computing technologies. According to the project's web site, they believe
"these two pillars form the technical foundations for next generation platforms and usages in the mobile and device
platforms space."

The MeeGo distribution infrastructure and the operating system base from the Linux kernel to the OS infrastructure up to
the middleware layer. The MeeGo architecture is based on a common core across the different usage models, such as
netbooks, handheld, in-vehicle, and connected TV. The MeeGo common core includes the various key subsystems including
the core operating system libraries, the comms and telephony services, internet and social networking services, visual
services, media services, data management, device services, and personal services.

OSUOSL will provide hosting, infrastructure, and distribution support for the production environment for the project as
well as the build server infrastructure. Now that MeeGo calls the OSL home, the Lab hopes to get undergrad students
involved in software development for the project. Other hardware-oriented projects OSL students have taken part in
include the One Laptop Per Child - OLPC - project.

Photos of MeeGo moving day were captured by Senior System Administrator Lance Albertson and can be viewed on our
