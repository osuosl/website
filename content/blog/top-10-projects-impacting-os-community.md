_The Open Source Lab serves as a trusted third-party home to some of the largest open source projects. By promoting
collaboration, accessibility and transparency, these projects are advancing the open source mission. The following (in
no particular order) are 10 projects that make a significant impact on the open source community._

1. **Apache Software Foundation**

   [The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) manages the development of many open source software
   packages, most notably the Apache Web server. The ASF was one of the OSL’s first hosted projects, coming aboard
   in 2003. The OSL provides hosting for the ASF's operational infrastructure.

2. **Linux Foundation**

   [The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) promotes, protects and advances Linux. To achieve these
   tasks, the Linux Foundation provides legal services to Linux developers, collaborates on the Linux Standards Base,
   hosts events for the Linux community and provides public relations regarding Linux. The OSL hosts the Linux
   Foundation's infrastructure including websites, email and development machines.

3. **phpBB**

   Used by websites ranging from VideoLan to Blender to MozillaZine, [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), a scalable and
   highly customizable open source bulletin board package, is a popular Web forum package. The OSL hosts the phpBB Web
   infrastructure.

4. **Gentoo Foundation**

   Gentoo Linux is a distribution built on a customizable foundation, allowing users to build a Linux system exactly the
   way they need it. The Gentoo community was the first hosted client of the OSL, and it still utilizes many servers and
   development platforms here. The OSL provides colocation hosting and FTP mirroring services for the
   [Gentoo Foundation](http://www.gentoo.org/), including colocation hosting for Polyp, a Chromebook being used by
   Gentoo for ARM development.

5. **Drupal**

   [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) is a PHP-based content management system used in many installations worldwide,
   including whitehouse.gov, npr.org, and examiner.com, along with several at Oregon State. When Drupal needed
   assistance with a Web server that was crippled under the load of its own popularity, the OSL -- along with the
   financial help of Drupal's users -- built a cluster for Drupal's websites that can scale along with its growth.

6. **Fedora Project**

   [The Fedora Project](http://fedoraproject.org/) is a community with the primary purpose of leading the advancement of
   free, open source software and content. The Fedora operating system (a Linux distribution) is the Fedora Project's
   flagship product. The OSL hosts the Fedora test servers, proof of concept hosts, and other needs that Fedora often
   runs into during the course of building a new Fedora release.

7. **Freenode**

   The Freenode Internet Relay Chat network facilitates open collaboration for people worldwide. It is used by many open
   source projects and is used extensively by the OSL. [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) contains around 40,000
   channels.The OSL hosts a Web server for Freenode.

8. **Python Software Foundation**

   A nonprofit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology, the
   [Python Software](http://python.org/psf/) Foundation’s mission is to promote, protect and advance the Python
   programming language. The OSL provides hosting for the PSF servers and the speed.python.org benchmarking server.

9. **CentOS**

   [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) is an enterprise-class Linux distribution operating system derived from sources
   freely provided to the public. CentOS developers provide technical support through chat rooms, mailing lists and web
   forums. The OSL hosts the CentOS master mirrors.

10. **Debian**

[Debian](http://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux is a distribution known for its stability and roots in the free software
philosophy. Created in 1993 by Ian Murdock, Debian is now supported by volunteer developers around the world. The OSL
hosts the server for bugs.debian.org, along with some of their internal infrastructure. The lab also hosts development
environments for MIPS and PPC.
