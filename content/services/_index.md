## [Hosting Services](/services/hosting/)

The OSL provides world-class [hosting services](/services/hosting/) for the Linux operating system, the Apache Software
Foundation, the Drupal content management system and more than 150 other leading open source
[communities](/communities).

We understand that every open source project has different hosting needs. We work with each project we host to meet
those needs and to create an infrastructure that will grow along with the project.

## [PowerLinux Development Hosting](/services/powerdev)

The OSL partners with [IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/linux/ltc/) to host
[POWER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerLinux)-based servers, making partitions and POWER-based KVM guests available
to the open source community. Community members can use these POWER servers to develop and test open source projects on
the Power architecture platform and in a PowerLinux environment. These systems are intended for functional development
and testing work, but are not to be used for performance testing.
