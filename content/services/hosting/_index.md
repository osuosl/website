Managed and Unmanaged Hosting
-----------------------------

Our hosting support staff members understand open source software and, matched
with our carrier-grade facilities, offer the perfect hosting environment for
your project.



We are flexible and work to meet the needs of each individual client. If you
have a server to host, need to purchase a server or simply a portion of a
server, we can help. We also make available a [full offering of services](/services/hosting/details) to
all of our hosted clients, reducing the amount of administration you are
required to do in your own infrastructure.


To Request Hosting
------------------

The Open Source Lab provides hosting for projects and communities involved with
open source software development. Typically we refer to the Open Source
Initiative's definition of open source, found at http://www.opensource.org. If
your project follows an open development model and is freely available under an
OSI-approved license, you may qualify for hosting. For more about which projects
we consider for hosting, see our [Hosting Policy](/services/hosting/policy).


To request hosting with the Open Source Lab, [please fill out this Hosting
Request form](/request-hosting)


*Please give us a few days to discuss and respond.*
